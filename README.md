# Hackathon SFSCON 2024 - Interactive Storefronts Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Interactive Storefronts Project** repository! 🎉 This project, developed for the SFSCON 2024 hackathon, aims to bring retail storefronts to life through AI-driven interactivity, providing a unique and engaging experience for passersby.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Transform traditional storefronts into interactive, intelligent displays that captivate and engage people as they walk by. Using real-time camera detection, conversational AI, and gesture-based mini-games, the project creates an immersive, memorable experience that blurs the line between the physical and digital worlds.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MediaPipe**: Powers gesture recognition, enabling passersby to interact with the display using hand movements.
- **ElevenLabs**: Provides natural, dynamic voice responses to engage users in conversation as they approach the storefront.
- **Python & JavaScript**: Python handles gesture recognition and camera input, while JavaScript integrates with the webpage to deliver responsive, real-time interactions.

## 📈 Future Goals

- **Multi-User Interaction**: Enable multiple users to engage simultaneously with the storefront.
- **Personalized Responses**: Tailor interactions based on individual profiles, offering a more customized experience.
- **Enhanced Mini-Games**: Develop additional interactive features and games to further engage users.
